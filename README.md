The task of this project was to create and set up a website for a fictional company by your own choose it just had to be a Museum. This was to learn HTML, CSS, and Figma.
## Description
In the semester project, we were tasked with testing what we had learned during our first year at Noroff. For this assignment, we had to develop a website for a museum. We were free to choose the name of the museum, so I decided to go for something local. The project started with designing in Figma, followed by setting up the structure in HTML, and then styling the website using CSS.
+ Design: make a visual design in figma
+ HTML: Build a webpage by using HTML to structure the projects.
+ CSS: to style the webpage, like fonts, color etc.
+ Responsive design: this is to make sure that the website works on different sizes(mobile, web, pad).
  
## Technology
For this project, we used three types of technologies.
+ Figma
+ HTML
+ CSS
